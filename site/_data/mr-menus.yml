##
## MAKE Roanoke Menus supports three placement menus that can be 
## displayed on each page: primary, secondary, footer.
##
## The primary menu is the menu displayed at the top of each page
## usually just under the header section or in a side bar.
##
## The secondary menu is not yet implemented and its location is TBD.
##
## The footer menu is displayed in the footer section of a page.
##
## Each of these placement menus are references to other real menus defined 
## in this YAML page.  They are set to the name of other real menus.  Note,
## the same real menu can be assigned to one or more of the placement menus.
##
primary:    main-menu
secondary:  
footer:     main-menu

##
## The variable menus is an array of real menu names.  Each time a new real
## menu is defined, its name needs to be added to this list.
##
menus:
  - main-menu
  - mock-main-menu
  - guild-halls
  - about-menu
