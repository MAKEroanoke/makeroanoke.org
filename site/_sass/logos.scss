 * Logo Overrides
 *      Basically Basic in file _global.scss selector: .site-logo forces
 *      the logo image to be turned into a round image using border-radius.
 *      This distorts the MAKE Roanoke logo.  The following is a CSS
 *      override of those settings (cascading).  This override also changes
 *      the size of the logo image.
 * .site-title is overwritten to reduce emphasis around title; consuming less
 * space on devices.
 *
 * See: masthead.html
