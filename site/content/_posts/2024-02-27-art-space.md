Recently we came across a survey put together by [Roanoke Arts Commission](https://roanokearts.org), which is looking for input from the local community about a new potential [Art Space](https://www.artspace.org/our-places) facility. The potential site of the facility selected is the [Riverdale Village](https://riverdaleroanoke.com/). While MAKE Roanoke itself is not directly affiliated, we think it is a great idea and would encourage anyone interested to take the survey.
