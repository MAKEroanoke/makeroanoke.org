Dear Roanoke Maker Community, we welcome you to a day of art and creativity on April 13th! [Daisy Art Parade](https://daisyartparade.com/) will be happening right in Downtown Roanoke. MAKERoanoke is planning on being there and so should you! A street parade will start at 12 o'clock sharp and will walk proceed from Norfolk Ave (near Taubman Museum of Art) to Elmwood Park. If you are interested in collaborating with us, please do reach out to us by email or join our Discord! Whether as part of the audience or as part of our Krewe, it would be lovely seeing you there.
