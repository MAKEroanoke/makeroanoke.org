**Attendees MUST register on the MeetUp!** <https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/305097793/> 

This class encompasses basics of Blender and low poly mesh modeling. It will cover what low poly mesh modeling is, and contrast it to CAD Design modeling. Additionally, techniques to bring in models from tools such as Fusion 360 will be presented, as well as fixing meshes and models.

This class will be taught by Amanda Kelly, Ettelie Lovern, and Harley Dishon. The class will be at South County library. We will be using Blender 3.6 (<https://www.blender.org/download/releases/3-6/>) a free, open-source software. Bringing a laptop with the software preinstalled is recommended. Since we will only be generating models with the intention to 3D Print them and will not be doing live animations, the system requirements (<https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/>) can be relaxed, and any fairly recent laptop should do a good job of running Blender. Also, please bring a mouse with 3 buttons (left, right, clickable scroll wheel, or 3 regular buttons) if you have it, it will make moving around within Blender much easier.

We can also provide laptops through the South Country Library, in order to use one you will just need to have a Library Card. If you do not have a library card and need one, please bring photo id, so that you may create one before the class. If you plan on borrowing a laptop, please bring a 3 button mouse (left, right, clickable scroll wheel, or 3 regular buttons), it will make moving around within Blender much easier.

This class is recommended for ages 16 and up. Attendees under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult. Space is limited, [so sign up now](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/305097793/)!
