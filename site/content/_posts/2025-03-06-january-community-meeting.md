MAKE Roanoke hosts a community meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: [128 Albemarle Ave SE in Roanoke](https://maps.app.goo.gl/eZaC8zNCK5MxukF8A)!

Come hang out with makers of all crafts from our community, learn about MAKE Roanoke's progress in opening up a makerspace in Roanoke, VA, and bring that cool project you're working on for show and tell!

Bring a chair if you're able, we have limited seating right now
