MAKE Roanoke hosts a community meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: 128 Albemarle Ave SE Unit B in Roanoke!

Come hang out with makers of all crafts from our community, learn about MAKE Roanoke's progress in opening up a makerspace in Roanoke, VA, and bring that cool project you're working on for show and tell!

Bring a chair if you're able, we have limited seating right now
