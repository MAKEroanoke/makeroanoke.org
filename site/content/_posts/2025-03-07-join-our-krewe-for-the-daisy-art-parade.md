MAKE Roanoke is excited to participate in the Daisy Art Parade [](https://www.instagram.com/daisyartparade/)again this year! We had so much fun with our Maker-Bot puppet last year, and have decided on a Maker Octopus theme for this year! We'll need your help in the planning and building of this large puppet, though!

Join the discussion on our [Discord](https://mkroa.org/discord) server, under Event Planning and be on the lookout for community build days where we work together to bring this aquatic inventor to life.
