MAKE Roanoke hosts Virtual Community Meetings on the Second Monday of each month at 6 pm on Google Meet! No sign-in is required to participate!Â [https://meet.google.com/ckf-jaic-knt](https://meet.google.com/ckf-jaic-knt?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0I87MPxEC08SRY4Sx0Wff900Qm-Yim7_sSMIk-WqTq5589seAJseGMOZc_aem_1Bo1hNJsLG4ISssxeKfDSg)

Come hang out with other makers of all crafts, learn about MAKE Roanoke's progress in opening a makerspace in Roanoke, VA, and show off that cool project you've been working on!

All are welcome and lurking is totally fine!
