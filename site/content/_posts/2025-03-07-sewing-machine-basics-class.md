**Attendees MUST register on the MeetUp!** Feb 15: <https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/305795001/> | March 1: <https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/305849941>

Come learn how to use a sewing machine at MAKE Roanoke! This class will teach how to use a sewing machine, sewing basics including straight and curved seams, and how to assemble simple items.

In this class, taught by Ettelie Lovern, Samantha Sullivan, Georgina Flynn-Smith, and Michelle Donohoe, students will make a wrench shaped dog toy (or a small wrench shaped pillow, if you prefer), complete with optional squeaker!

This class is suitable for complete beginners, but we will have optional, decorative steps for more experienced students. If you have your own sewing machine, we recommend bringing it so you can learn on your own machine. We will also have machines for people to use who don't have their own.

This class is recommended for ages 16+. All attendees under 18 must be accompanied by an adult. The admission fee of $20 includes all taxes and fees.\

Update: Due to popular demand, we have added an extra session of this class on March 1! Both sessions are identical.
