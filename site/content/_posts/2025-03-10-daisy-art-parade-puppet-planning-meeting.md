MAKE Roanoke is thrilled to be participating in the Daisy Art Parade again this year! For those who don't know, the Daisy Art Parade is a parade through downtown Roanoke of giant puppets that people in our community make! All puppets must be man-powered (IE no cars towing them!) and using recycled material is highly encouraged. This year the parade is on May 10!Â [Learn more about the parade](https://daisyartparade.com/about/).

MAKE Roanoke has settled on a "Maker Octopus" theme for this year, with each tentacle using a different tool.

This meeting will focus on the planning of said puppet, including choosing materials, making a rough design plan, and creating a shopping list. This is the time to have your creative ideas heard! We will be scheduling several build days in the future to create this awesome puppet!

You do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to be a part of our Daisy Art Parade Krewe! All crafts and experience levels welcome!
