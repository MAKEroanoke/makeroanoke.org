MAKE Roanoke is heading to the Lynchburg Maker Faire on Sunday, March 30th, and we want YOU to be a part of it.

The Lynchburg Maker Faire is a celebration of creativity, innovation, and the "maker spirit." It's a fantastic opportunity to showcase your talents, learn from other makers, and ignite a spark of inspiration in attendees of all ages.

Here's how you can get involved:

**Show Off Your Creations!**

We're searching for eye-catching, easily transportable creations to display at our booth. This is your chance to put your craftsmanship on center stage and inspire fellow makers!  Think small sculptures, intricate wood carvings, 3D printed marvels, or any other amazing creation that fits the bill. 

**Volunteer to staff our table!**

We need community members to help staff our table and tell people about MAKE Roanoke as they come up to it. We'll train you on the engraving machine and other interactive exhibits we have.
