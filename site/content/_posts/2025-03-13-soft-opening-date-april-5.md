Big news from our virtual community meeting on Monday, we are pleased to announce a Soft Opening Date of April 5! 

At that point we'll have a list of all the equipment that's ready for people to use (some pieces still need to get up and running, some need some ventilation installed, etc) and will be accepting memberships. Memberships will cost $50/mo and get you access to the space via a keyfob for all the equipment that you're trained on. 

In order to be a member, you'll have to attend a General Orientation. We'll be having the first at our Community Meeting on March 27 and another on April 5 (time tbd). More General Orientations will be scheduled at a future date. General Orientation gets you access to any green-level tools in the space. 

In order to access Yellow and Red level tools, you will need to go through specific shop (yellow) and tool (red) orientations. These are also TBD and depend in part on our Shop Captains.

We will send out an email in the next couple of weeks to convert any $10 memberships to $50 memberships. You must convert to a $50 full membership to get access to the space and to maintain voting rights. If you have an annual membership from Kickstarter you *can* start it on April 5 but *must* start it by our Grand Opening Date (tbd).
