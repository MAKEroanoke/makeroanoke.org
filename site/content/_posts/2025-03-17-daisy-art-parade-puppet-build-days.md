MAKE Roanoke is thrilled to be participating in the Daisy Art Parade again this year! For those who don't know, the Daisy Art Parade is a parade through downtown Roanoke of giant puppets that people in our community make! All puppets must be man-powered (IE no cars towing them!) and using recycled material is highly encouraged. This year the parade is on May 10! [You can learn more about the parade here.](https://daisyartparade.com/about/)

You do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to be a part of our Daisy Art Parade Krewe! All crafts and experience levels welcome!

If you have any of these materials to contribute towards the puppet, please bring them!

* Chicken Wire
* Fabric or Paper mache
* 4" flexible ducting (Prefer vinyl over aluminum for durability of movement), in lengths of at least 6 feet
* 8 Hose Clamps for 4"
* 8 flanges for 4" tube
* Long Poles/ Dowels (Preferably poles that have a screw end for easy attachment points)
* Felt in white and yellow
* Wood to build a new cart (if needed)
* Wheels (if needed)
* Blue tarp or other material for apron around cart
