MAKE Roanoke is hosting Space Improvement Days at least once per month!

Come volunteer your time to improve our community makerspace. Space Improvement Days are for any and all projects to improve our space from cleaning, to painting walls, to repairing plumbing, to sewing window dressings. No personal projects may be worked on at the shop on Space Improvement Days.

Volunteers must have a signed waiver on file, and anyone under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult, and their waiver must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.
