Spring is just around the corner!
Learn to weave an Egg Basket, just in time for Easter! These baskets are well designed for gathering eggs. (Because the eggs won’t roll around in the curved bottom, they’re less likely to break.) Of course, they can be made in various sizes and proportions and are useful for holding many things.

Handy tools to bring along if you have them (But no worries! We will share if you don’t!):

* Sturdy Scissors or Garden Clippers
* Sharp Knife
* Awl or Small Flathead Screwdriver
* Clothespins
* Towel to keep your lap dry
* StringNeedle nose pliers
* Flexible Measuring Tape

The class is taught by Sarah Starkey. This class is recommended for ages 12 and up. Attendees under the age of 16 must be accompanied by an adult. Attendees under the age of 18 must have a waiver signed by a parent or legal guardian.

The cost of the class is $30 and includes all taxes and fees, as well as the rest of the materials needed to make your basket. You can pay via PayPal, Venmo, or with Cash.

Space is limited, so sign up now!
