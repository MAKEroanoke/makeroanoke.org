![Community Meeting Graphic, March 27 Thursday 6-8 PM, Community Meeting & General Orientation, MAKE Roanoke 128 Albemarle Ave SE Roanoke VA](/assets/images/2025-3-27-march-community-meeting-meetup.png)

MAKE Roanoke hosts a community meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: 128 Albemarle Ave SE, B in Roanoke!

Come hang out with makers of all crafts from our community, learn about MAKE Roanoke's progress in opening up a makerspace in Roanoke, VA, and bring that cool project you're working on for show and tell!

We will be having our first General Orientation following this meeting! This orientation is required for new members (we will have another on April 5 if you can't make this one!)

Bring a chair if you're able, we have limited seating right now
