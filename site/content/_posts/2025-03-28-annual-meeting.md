MAKE Roanoke hosts a community meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: 128 Albemarle Ave SE, Unit B in Roanoke!

Come hang out with makers of all crafts from our community, get updates from Roanoke's own non-profit community makerspace, and bring that cool project you're working on for maker show and tell!

This community meeting is also our Annual Meeting, and we will be having Board Elections. You must be a full member to vote.

Bring a chair if you're able, we have limited seating right now
