MAKE Roanoke is pleased to announce a Soft Opening Date of April 5!

On Saturday, we'll have a list of all the equipment that's ready for people to use (some pieces still need to get up and running, some need some ventilation installed, etc) and will be accepting memberships. Memberships will cost $50/mo and get you access to the space via a keyfob for all the equipment that you're trained on.

In order to be a member, you'll have to attend a General Orientation. We will be hosting 5 General Orientations on Saturday, at the top of every hour, with the first one at 1:00 PM and the last one starting at 5:00 PM. **Everyone in attendance must be wearing closed-toe shoes.**

The Orientations will consist of a tour showcasing what MAKE Roanoke has to offer, a video explaining our rules and procedures, a briefer tour highlighting safety equipment, and then time for Q&A and signing up for memberships.

Please note that additional shop-level orientations and tool-level training are required to use most tools.

You do not have to sign up for a membership, if you want to just take the tour and/or orientation to learn more, that's totally ok!
