New Members of MAKE Roanoke are required to attend a General Orientation. **Attendees must RSVP on the MeetUp Events.**

* [April 17 at 6PM](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/307179434/?eventOrigin=group_calendar)
* [April 19 at 6PM and 7 PM](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/307179454/?eventOrigin=group_calendar)
* April 24 after the Annual Meeting (no RSVP Required, and going forward there will always be an opportunity to take a General Orientation after a community meeting)

Memberships will cost $50/mo and get you access to the space via a keyfob for all the equipment that you're trained on.Â [Find out more about MAKE Roanoke Membership here](https://makeroanoke.org/membership)

The Orientations will consist of a tour showcasing what MAKE Roanoke has to offer, a video explaining our rules and procedures, a briefer tour highlighting safety equipment, and then time for Q&A and signing up for memberships.

Please note that additional shop-level orientations and tool-level training are required to use most tools.

You do not have to sign up for a membership, if you want to just take the tour and/or orientation to learn more, that's totally ok!
