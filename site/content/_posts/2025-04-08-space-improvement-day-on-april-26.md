MAKE Roanoke hosts Space Improvement Days on the last Saturday of every month!

Come volunteer your time to improve our community makerspace. Space Improvement Days are for any and all projects to improve our space from cleaning, to painting walls, to repairing plumbing, to sewing window dressings.Â **No personal projects may be worked on at the shop on Space Improvement Days**.

Volunteers must have a signed waiver on file, and anyone under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult, and their waiver must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.

Agenda items can be found [on the MeetUp Event](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/307181853/?eventOrigin=group_calendar) !

**Please note that MAKE Roanoke is an active workshop:**

* All participants must have a signed waiver on file. If the participant is a minor, the waiver must be signed by a parent or court-appointed legal guardian.
* Children who are not participating in the event are not permitted in the space.
* Closed toed shoes are required in the space at all times by everyone, regardless of age or participation in an event. No sandals, crocs, or bare feet.
* You may be asked to remove or tuck in dangling jewelry, lanyards, etc for safety.
