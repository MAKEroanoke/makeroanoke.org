MAKE Roanoke is thrilled to be participating in the Daisy Art Parade again this year! For those who don't know, the Daisy Art Parade is a parade through downtown Roanoke of giant puppets that people in our community make! All puppets must be man-powered (IE no cars towing them!) and using recycled material is highly encouraged. This year the parade is on May 10! [You can learn more about the parade here.](https://daisyartparade.com/about/)

You do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to be a part of our Daisy Art Parade Krewe! All crafts and experience levels welcome!

If you have any of these materials to contribute towards the puppet, please bring them!

* Long Poles/ Dowels (Preferably poles that have a screw end for easy attachment points)
* Felt in white and yellow
* Wood to build a new cart 
* Sturdy casters with tires
