  Come MAKE your very own open-source hardware mixer at this class hosted by
  MAKE Roanoke! Using hands-on soldering and microprocessor programming and
  flashing, students will build a physical mixer, which can be plugged into a
  computer to seamlessly control the volumes of different apps.

  We recommend students have experience with basic soldering or some programming experience. Students must bring a laptop (ideally Windows or Linux, but we can work with Mac).

We are excited to offer a class in applied electronics! Students will get to do hands-on soldering, microprocessor programming and flashing, and learn about what open source hardware is. At the end of the class, students will build a physical mixer, which can be plugged into a computer and uses knobs to seamlessly control the volumes of different apps.

Due to the complexity of this project and time constraints, we recommend attendees to have experience with basic soldering or some programming experience (any kind of experience is okay).

This class will be taught by **Aaron McPhall** with help from **Stan Okrasinski,** and **Sam B**. Most materials will be provided; all you need is a laptop (Windows or Linux is ideal, but we can work with Mac).

This class is recommended for ages 16 and up. Attendees under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult. Space is limited, so sign up now! The discounted rate for Full MAKE Roanoke Members is $25. [Find out more about MAKE Roanoke Membership here](https://makeroanoke.org/membership)
