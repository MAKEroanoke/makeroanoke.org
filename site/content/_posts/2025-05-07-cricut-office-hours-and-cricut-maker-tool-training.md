excerpt: "We're trying something new with Office Hours at MAKE Roanoke! Designed
  to offer help using a specific tool or craft, Office Hours are open to the
  public to get hands-on assistance with your next project. Our first set of
  Office Hours will be for the Cricut on Tuesday, May 20 from 6-8 PM. We'll have
  several Cricuts available to cut out vinyl, fabric, leather, cardstock, and
  very thin balsa wood and people who can help bring your project to life.
  Members can also come to get trained on our Cricut Maker so they can use it
  whenever they want! "

Join us for Office Hours: Cricut Edition at MAKE Roanoke! This event is open to everyone! You do *not* need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to attend. This event has a suggested donation of $5+ depending on the size of your project.

Bring your Cricut-Related craft, project, or idea for hands-on help, including the use of our Cricut machines! We'll have some adhesive and heat-transfer (iron-on) vinyl available, but if you need a large quantity or a specific color we ask that you provide it yourselves. Vinyl can be purchased locally at Target, Walmart, and Michaels.

Cricut machines are computer-controlled die-cutting machines that can cut quite intricate patterns out. Project ideas include fun labels for your kitchen, glass etching, faux wood burning, custom t-shirt designs and more! We can also cut fabric, cardstock, leather, and very thin balsa wood!

MAKE Roanoke Members can also come and get trained on our Cricut Maker so they can use it whenever they want!
