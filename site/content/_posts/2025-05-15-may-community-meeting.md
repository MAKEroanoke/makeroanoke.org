MAKE Roanoke hosts a community meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: 128 Albemarle Ave SE, Unit B in Roanoke!

Come hang out with makers of all crafts from our community, get updates from Roanoke's own non-profit community makerspace, and bring that cool project you're working on for maker show and tell!

There will also be an opportunity to take a General Orientation for prospective and new members!
