MAKE Roanoke is pleased to announce more shop orientations for its members! The first wood shop orientations will take place on Saturday, May 24 at 2 and 3 pm. Completing this orientation will unlock the yellow level tools in the Wood Shop, including hand drills and hand sanders, and will cover shop policies and the dust collection system. You must complete this orientation before being trained on any red level tools (saws, bench tools, any hand power tool with a blade).\
