Full MAKE Roanoke Members can earn their Fiber Arts tool access on Thursday, June 12! There are two options, and feel free to attend both. 

The [6 PM Orientation ](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/308309784/?slug=make-roanoke&eventId=307271045&isFirstPublish=true)will cover the shop-level orientation and get members access to the 4 domestic sewing machines and our yellow-level hand tools. 

The [7 PM Tool-Training](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/308309904/?slug=make-roanoke&eventId=308309904) will offer training on your choice of our Red Level tools including:

* Janome Memory Craft 10001 for Embroidery
* Janome Juno Serger
* Cricut Maker
* Sailrite LSZ-1 

Please note that to receive training on our red-level tools you must have first taken a shop-level orientation. 

Members MUST RSVP at the MeetUp Events, linked above, as we can only train 5 people at a time.

If you are interested in taking a Fiber Arts Orientation, but these times don't work for you, please reach out to Samantha (samantha@makeroanoke.org) to schedule a one-on-one session.
