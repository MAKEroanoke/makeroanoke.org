Are you looking to get hands-on experience with crocheting? Sometimes it is difficult to get started, especially at the very beginning. MAKE Roanoke is excited to offer a workshop on crocheting using the Woobles Kit ([https://thewoobles.com](https://thewoobles.com/)).

Come make Chimmy (<https://thewoobles.com/products/chimmy-crochet-kit>), a one-of-a-kind friend. We will have a kit for each student, and will offer assistance during the workshop. This class is suitable for beginners. Some of the things covered will be how to use a hook, how to read patterns, and different stitching patterns. **Please bring a device with headphones since the detailed crocheting instructions are in video form (also available in written form).**

The class is taught by Samantha Dunne, Dani S and Ettelie Lovern. This class is recommended for ages 16 and up, and is suitable for beginners. Attendees under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult. Space is limited, so sign up now!

The price of the class is $30, and the price for Full MAKE Roanoke Members is $20. **NEW: MAKE Roanoke Members can now bring 1 guest per class at the Discounted Member rate!**

All Attendees must [RSVP on the Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310706241/?eventOrigin=group_calendar) and have a waiver on file with MAKE Roanoke. [Fill out your waiver ahead of time here.](https://us.services.docusign.net/webforms-ux/v1.0/forms/72d9a28645d0d44d07d3badb8b83103f)
