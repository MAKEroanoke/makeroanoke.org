Are you looking to get hands-on experience with crocheting? Sometimes it is difficult to get started, especially at the very beginning. MAKE Roanoke is excited to offer our very first workshop on crocheting using the[ Woobles Kit](https://thewoobles.com).

Come make [Chimmy](https://thewoobles.com/products/chimmy-crochet-kit), a one-of-a-kind friend. We will have a kit for each student, and will offer assistance during the workshop. This class is suitable for beginners. Some of the things covered will be how to use a hook, how to read patterns, and different stitching patterns. Don't worry about not having enough time to finish Chimmy, we will have office hours on subsequent days after the workshop ends. Please bring a device with headphones since the detailed crocheting instructions are in video form (also available in written form).

The class is taught by Samantha Dunne, Dani S, Ettelie Lovern, and Alex Myers. This class is recommended for ages 16 and up, and is suitable for beginners. Attendees under the age of 18 must be accompanied by an adult. Space is limited, so sign up now!

Price for Full MAKE Roanoke Members is $25

All Attendees must have a waiver on file with MAKE Roanoke.Â [Fill out your waiver ahead of time here.](https://us.services.docusign.net/webforms-ux/v1.0/forms/72d9a28645d0d44d07d3badb8b83103f)
