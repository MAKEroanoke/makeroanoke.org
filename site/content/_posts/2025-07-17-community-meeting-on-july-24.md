MAKE Roanoke hosts a community meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: 128 Albemarle Ave SE, Unit B in Roanoke!

Come hang out with makers of all crafts from our community, get updates from Roanoke's own non-profit community makerspace, and bring that cool project you're working on for maker show and tell!

As always, community meetings are open to the public! All are welcome. Please wear closed toed shoes, as we are an active workshop!
