We're bringing back our very popular Sewing Machine Basics class! Join us August 16 at the Williamson Rd Library to make your own dog (or cat!) toy! This class teaches you how to use a sewing machine, how to sew straight and curved seams, and how to assemble simple items. 

It is suitable for complete beginners. but we do have optional steps for more experienced students.

We do have some sewing machines for people to use, but if you have your own, we recommend bringing it as it's best to learn the quirks of your own machine. 

Fee is $25, or $15 if you're a MAKE Roanoke Member. [Attendees MUST RSVP on the MeetUp Event!](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310108070/?eventOrigin=group_calendar)
