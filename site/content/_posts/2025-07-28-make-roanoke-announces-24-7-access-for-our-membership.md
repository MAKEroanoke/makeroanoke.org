Big news! We're now able to offer 24/7 access to the space, so you can come in at any hour to work on your project! Simply use your key fob on the reader next to the pink exterior door and pull on the handle (no turning!) when you hear the click. It might take a couple of swipes while we perfect the software, but usually works within 3 taps. 

Please let us know if you have any issues! We can "bump" the door open remotely as well, if needed.
