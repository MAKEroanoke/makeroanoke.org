Join fellow cosplayers for a collaborative day to work on projects together. All fandoms welcome! This event is open to the community - you do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke member to attend.

We will provide basic tools (needle, thread, scissors, glue, etc.), but feel free to bring your own specialty tools to work on your project.
Use of MAKE Roanoke equipment (sewing machines, 3D printers, etc.) requires membership and prior tool certification.
