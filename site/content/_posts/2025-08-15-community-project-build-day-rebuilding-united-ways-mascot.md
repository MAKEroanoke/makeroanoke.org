Calling all cosplayers and costume makers!

United Way of Virginia's Blue Ridge has teamed up with MAKE Roanoke to rebuild their mascot costume! The current white glove costume is quite old, hot, and has the old logo. It's time for a refresh!

We'll be rebuilding the costume using EVA Foam and a backpack frame, sewing a custom cover and more. You do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to help with this build project! All are welcome, especially if you have experience working with EVA Foam or want to learn how!

Our next build day is on Friday August 22 at 6pm, and we will be assembling the costume, gluing the sidewalls to the front and back hands. 

Closed Toe Shoes and waivers are required for all participants! Find out more: <https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310235749/>
