Meetup is a platform for companies and groups to schedule and manage events. Groups like MAKE Roanoke pay a fee, and individuals can use the platform for free. Meetup+ is their paid subscription for individuals, but it is **not required** to use Meetup to attend MAKE Roanoke events. You must be 18+ to use Meetup, per their policies.

## How to Sign-Up for the free version of Meetup: 

1. Go to [meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) and click the “sign up” button in the upper right corner. You can sign up with Google, Apple, Facebook or a traditional email and password.

2. Pick a few interests (you have to select at least 3)
3. Enter your date of birth (it won’t be public)
4. Select your gender, if you want to
5. Select groups you’d like to join. If MAKE Roanoke isn’t a suggested group for you, you can find it here [[https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/?eventOrigin=home_groups_you_organize)] after the sign up process is complete. 
6. You’ll get a pop-up advertising Meetup+, towards the top of the pop-up is a link “continue with free plan”, select that if you don’t want to pay for Meetup

## Finding MAKE Roanoke Events on Meetup

Your homepage on Meetup will have events listed in chronological order for all the groups that you join, as well as some suggested local groups. If you scroll down below the calendar, you’ll see a section for “Your groups” and should see MAKE Roanoke listed there. If you don’t, you can [click here](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/) to add MAKE Roanoke to your groups! Click MAKE Roanoke and you’ll see our Meetup page.

Under our logo, you’ll see 5 buttons, and below that a brief bio of MAKE Roanoke and our next 4 events. That’s not all of our events though! Click “Events” under our logo to see a list of all of our scheduled events.

Once there, you can also click “Calendar” to see the events in a calendar format instead of a list. Click an event to find out more about it.

## RSVPing on Meetup

While MAKE Roanoke puts all of our events on Meetup, we only enforce the RSVPs for our classes, which have limited seating. You might be surprised to come to a Community Meeting that only has 3 RSVPs to find 30+ people in attendance! 

### RSVP to save your spot

To RSVP for an event, simply click the red “Attend” button in the lower right corner. Depending on the event, you might be asked a question to help us plan better, or to confirm that you will pay for the event. Once you RSVP for an event, it will show up on your Meetup homepage under “Your next events” below the calendar.

## Change of plans? Change your RSVP to free up a spot

If you decide you can’t make an event after all, we ask that you please edit your RSVP to reflect this. To do so, navigate to the event page again, and click “Edit RSVP” on the bottom right. In the pop-up, you can select “Not Going” to change your RSVP. This really helps us out when we have limited seating as it frees up a seat for another person.

![Choose "Not Going" to free your spot for someone else.](/assets/images/meetup-unrsvp-2.png "Choose Not Going")

## Waitlist

Meetup also has waitlists for when a limited-attendance event is fully booked. You can join the waitlist, and if someone changes their RSVP to “Not Going” then the first person on the waitlist will automatically be confirmed as going. Meetup will send you an email confirming this as well. The waitlist order is chronological, but Meetup+ users do get priority (MAKE Roanoke is unable to change that functionality).
