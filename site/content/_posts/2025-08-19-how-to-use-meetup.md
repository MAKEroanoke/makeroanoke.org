Meetup is a platform for companies and groups to schedule and manage events. Groups like MAKE Roanoke pay a fee, and individuals can use the platform for free. Meetup+ is their paid subscription for individuals, but it is **not required** to use Meetup to attend MAKE Roanoke events. You must be 18+ to use Meetup, per their policies.

# How to Sign-Up for the free version of Meetup: 

Go to [meetup.com](http://meetup.com/) and click the “sign up” button in the upper right corner. You can sign up with Google, Apple, Facebook or a traditional email and password.
