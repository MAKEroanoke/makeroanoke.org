**Attendees MUST RSVP on the [Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310601981/?slug=make-roanoke&eventId=310601981)**

Join us at MAKE Roanoke as **Avni Patel** teaches our first Jewelry Making Class!

Students will transform 5 grams of Silver metal clay into a stunning leaf pendant. The process includes rolling the clay, using a leaf to create an impression, cutting the excess clay, and refining the rough edges. Students will also add a bail, allowing it to be attached to a chain, and then dry the piece on a hot plate.

Once dry, a blow torch will be used to fire the clay, turning it into solid metal. Finally, students will polish and patina your creation to perfection.

This class is designed for students aged 18 and up and is priced at $60. The price for MAKE Roanoke Members is $50. [Find out more about MAKE Roanoke Membership here.](https://makeroanoke.org/membership) Don’t miss the opportunity to craft your own beautiful metal pendant!

Please note: jewelry chains are not provided. Please comment if you would like to purchase one for $12.
