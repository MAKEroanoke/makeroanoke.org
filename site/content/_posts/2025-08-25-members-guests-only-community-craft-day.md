Come and create for the sake of creating!

Stuck in a creative rut? Need something fun to do? Bring a friend and come hangout at MAKE Roanoke for a Community Craft night. Paint, draw, write, sew, or just twist a couple of pipe cleaners together.

MAKE Roanoke will provide a few materials for you to get the creative juices flowing, but feel free to bring something to work on or materials to share.

This event runs from 4-8pm and is for MAKE Roanoke members and a guest.

***Limited Pizza will be available, please [RSVP on the Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310701402/?slug=make-roanoke&eventId=310701402&isFirstPublish=true) so we know how much to order!***
