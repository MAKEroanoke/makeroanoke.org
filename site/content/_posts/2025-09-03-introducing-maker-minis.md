MAKE Roanoke is pleased to introduce a new series of FREE short classes we're calling Maker Minis! Maker Minis are brief ~1 hour classes that are meant to introduce concepts or useful techniques. They may be related to specific shops, or they can be pertinent to different making concepts, and they cover things outside the scope of orientations. Our first one will be an Intro to Metrology class on September 11 at 6 PM at MAKE Roanoke. 

This class, taught by Chris Santacroce, will teach you the fundamentals of precise measurements. This class is recommended for people ages 12 and up. Attendees under 18 must be accompanied by an adult.

In this hands-on mini class you will learn:

* Terminology of Accurate and Precise Measurement
* Usage of Scales, Tapes, and Calipers
* Conversion between different Units of Measurement

[Spots are limited, please RSVP here!](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310838134/?eventOrigin=group_events_list)
