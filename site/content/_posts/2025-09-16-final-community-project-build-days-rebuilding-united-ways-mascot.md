Calling all cosplayers and costume makers!

United Way of Virginia's Blue Ridge has teamed up with MAKE Roanoke to rebuild their mascot costume! The current white glove costume is quite old, hot, and has the old logo. It's time for a refresh!

We're adding final touches to the EVA foam hand and are starting the fabric glove cover!

Our next (and hopefully final) build days is on [Wednesday Sept 17](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/311007425/) at 6 pm and [Sunday Sept 21](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/311007436/) from 4-8 pm. 

Closed Toe Shoes and waivers are required for all participants! [](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/310235749/)
