MAKE Roanoke is pleased to announce that the CNC Router, a Shapeoko 4XL, is now ready for trainings! The first trainings will take place on [Tuesday, September 23 at 6 pm](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/311106760/) and [Sunday, September 28 at 4 pm](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/311106768/). Please RSVP on the Meetups to reserve your spot.

You must have already completed the Wood Shop Orientation.

This training is the first step in getting access to our Shapeoko 4XL CNC Router, the second half of training will be a one-on-one session scheduled individually when you have a part to make. **You must complete both sessions in order to use the CNC Router independently.**

This session will go over the software used to control the CNC Router, [Carbide Create. ](https://carbide3d.com/carbidecreate/download/)Please bring a laptop with that software downloaded if you would like to follow along.

This orientation will go over basic workflow, but [this online video series](https://carbide3d.com/hub/courses/create/) is a complete overview of the software and basics. Watching the video series is not a substitution for attending the orientation.
