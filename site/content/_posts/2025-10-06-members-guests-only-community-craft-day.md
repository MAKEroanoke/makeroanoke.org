This event was so fun last month we decided to make it a monthly event!

Come work on whatever project you want and enjoy the company of fellow MAKE Roanoke Members! Carve out some time to create for the sake of creating! From coloring to making hats to restoring machinery, this is a social night of crafting of all kinds for makers of all kinds!

Bring some dough to chip in for dinner if you want some!

This event runs from 4-8pm and is for MAKE Roanoke members and guests.
