MAKE Roanoke is pleased to offer another session in our series of FREE short classes we're calling Maker Minis! This one is about joinery jigs for wood working and will take place on Wednesday, Nov 5 at 6 pm!

This Maker Mini, taught by Matt Brown, will demonstrate two methods
joining wood with the pocket hole jig and the dowel jig. We will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of each method and then youâ€™ll get to try your hand at each.

This class is suitable for beginners, and is recommended for ages 14 and up. All minors must be accompanied by an adult.

Seating is limited, so please [RSVP on the Meetup Event ](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/311752938/?eventOrigin=group_calendar)to save your seat!
