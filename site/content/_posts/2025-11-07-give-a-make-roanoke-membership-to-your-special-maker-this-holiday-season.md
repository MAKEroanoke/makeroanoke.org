MAKE Roanoke is now pleased to offer Gift Memberships, the perfect gift for any maker in your life. 

Gift memberships are available for individual, couple, and student tiers (valid Student ID required for the member), and can be purchased for 3, 6, or 12 months. 12 months is an excellent value as it gives you a month free!

Gift Memberships must be started within 6 months of purchase, and have no cash value. To give extra time in the holiday season, gift memberships purchased in November or December must be started by July 1 of the following year. 

Recipients of Gift Memberships must follow all standard Membership policies and protocols at MAKE Roanoke.
