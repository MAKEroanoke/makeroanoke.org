Create a rectangular reed basket to decorate your home, carry essentials, or fill with goodies for an extraordinary gift basket!

Come to class with an idea of what you’d like to carry in your basket, & you can make it to size **(measure the length, width, & height).** For instance: Your basket could be quite shallow to carry a casserole dish, tall to carry 2 bottles of wine, square as a catch-all for keys at your entryway, or rectangular for carrying gifts to the car.

This class is suitable for beginners to intermediates. It's appropriate for ages 9 and up with adult supervision.

The cost for this class is $40, and the cost for Full MAKE Roanoke Members is $30. MAKE Roanoke Members can also bring 1 guest at the discounted member rate! [Learn more about MAKE Roanoke Membership here](https://makeroanoke.org/membership)[.](https://makeroanoke.org/membership) Payment is taken at the door by PayPal, Cash, or Card (including tap-to-pay and Apple Pay).
