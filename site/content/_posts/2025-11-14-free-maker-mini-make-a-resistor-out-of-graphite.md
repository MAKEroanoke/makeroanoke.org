MAKE Roanoke is pleased to offer another session in our series of FREE short classes we're calling Maker Minis! This one is about resistors and circuit boards!

This Maker Mini will cover voltage, current, and resistance as it applies to a circuit board. We'll show you how to use a multimeter and then participants will be able to make a resistor out of graphite.

This class is suitable for beginners, and is recommended for ages 12 and up. All minors must be accompanied by an adult.

Seating is limited, so please [RSVP to save your seat on the Meetup Event](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/311992716/?eventOrigin=attendee_list)!
