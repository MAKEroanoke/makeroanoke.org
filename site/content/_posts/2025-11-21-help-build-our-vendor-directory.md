"Hey where'd you get that wood?"\
"Where can I buy fabric now that JoAnn is closed?" \
"Can I get any 3D Printing Filament locally?"

These are all questions MAKE Roanoke is asked regularly, and there are so many hidden gems in our region that we'd love to direct Roanoke Makers to shop at! We need your help filling out this directory with your favorite shops and vendors for making of all crafts. 

If you have a shop you'd like to add to our Vendor Directory, please fill out this [brief form](https://mkroa.org/vendors)\

You can view our current [Vendor Directory on our Wiki](https://wiki.makeroanoke.org/doku.php?id=vendors).
