MAKE Roanoke is proud to be an approved charity for both the Commonwealth of Virginia Campaign and the Combined Federal Campaign, so Virginia State Employees and Federal Employees can donate to us through one time donations or payroll deductions.

For Virginia State Employees, if your state employer is participating in the Commonwealth of Virginia Campaign, you can find MAKE Roanoke through the [CVC Portal](https://cvc.virginia.gov/employees.html) using code **201622.** Last year MAKE Roanoke raised nearly $250 through the CVC!

For Federal Employees, you can find MAKE Roanoke through the [CFC Portal](https://cfcgiving.opm.gov/welcome) using code **65547**

**All Donations and Pledges must be completed by Dec 31, 2025 to count in the campaigns!**

For non-government employees: MAKE Roanoke is also approved on both **Benevity** and the **Walmart Spark Good Associate Program**. Check with your employer to see if they do any sort of giving for volunteering or donation matching. If your employer uses a different service, let us know by email info@makeroanoke.org and we'll apply! 

Thank you for supporting MAKE Roanoke!
