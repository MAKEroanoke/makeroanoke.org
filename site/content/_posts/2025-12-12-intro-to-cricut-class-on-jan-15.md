Join us at MAKE Roanoke for this Intro to Cricut class!

Students will learn the basics of Cricut Design Space to make vinyl stickers and learn how to utilize the Print-Then-Cut feature to make custom stickers. We will cover how to use the free features of design space to make your own designs, how to import designs from other softwares, how to cut vinyl, weed the sticker, and transfer the sticker to it's final destination. We will also demonstrate the print-then-cut features.

This is a great class to learn how to use your Cricut machine or to learn if a Cricut machine is right for you.

**Attendees must install the Free Cricut Design Space app** onto their tablet, or laptop and bring that device with them. (We do not recommend using it on a smart phone for this class). Note: you'll have to sign up for a free Cricut account to use their software as well.

If you have a Cricut to use, please bring it and a power cord with you! We will also have some Cricuts available for people to share during the event. **If you bring your own, please note its Bluetooth ID before coming.** This is the name it shows up as under your connected Bluetooth devices on your computer or phone.

This class is open to the public, you do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to attend. It does count for Cricut Tool Certification for MAKE Roanoke Members. This class is suitable for beginners, and open to those age 12 or higher.

Cost to attend is $25, and cost for MAKE Roanoke Members is $15. MAKE Roanoke Members can also bring one guest at the discounted member rate. Space is limited, attendees MUST register on the [Meetup Event!](https://www.meetup.com/make-roanoke/events/312411220/?eventOrigin=group_events_list)
