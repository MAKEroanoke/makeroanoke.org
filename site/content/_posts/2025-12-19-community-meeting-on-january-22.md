Join us at MAKE Roanoke for our monthly Community Meeting on the fourth Thursday of each month at our location: 128 Albemarle Ave SE, Unit B in Roanoke!

The evening starts with a slideshow sharing the latest updates about Roanoke's own non-profit community makerspace, including upcoming events, new tools, and member announcements. After the updates, we open the floor for "Maker Show and Tell" where anyone can showcase their creative projects--whether it's a 3D Print, a woodworking piece, electronics project, embroidery, or any other creative endeavor.

It's a welcoming space to connect with your fellow Roanoke makers, get inspired, collaborate, and share your passion for making!

These meetings are free and open to the public, you do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to attend!

**Please note that MAKE Roanoke is an active workshop:**


* Closed toed shoes are required in the space at all times by everyone, regardless of age or participation in an event. No sandals, crocs, or bare feet.
* You may be asked to remove or tuck in dangling jewelry, lanyards, etc for safety.
