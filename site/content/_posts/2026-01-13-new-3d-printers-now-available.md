From our 3D Printing Shop Captain

I have some exciting news about our shop!

# New 3D Printer - Bambu Lab P1S 

We have a new printer in the 3D printing lab, thanks to our generous members! This printer will be available for use starting this evening at community craft day. The P1S has been upgraded with a hardened steel nozzle and extruder gears, which makes material compatibility equivalent to the X1C. Our new P1S also has its own AMS unit, which means it can do multicolor and multi-material printing. 

If you have received training for the X1C previously, you are **already signed off** to use the new P1S as well. The same procedures apply. 

To get started, install the default P1S profile in Orcaslicer, and then download and import the MAKE Roanoke profile from the wiki. To set generic (non-bambu brand) filaments in the AMS, it is done in the device tab of the slicer, not at the machine. 

Before using, please review the new wiki page for this printer here:

Thank you again to our generous members who made this possible!

# Elegoo Saturn 3 - Now in Service

Our Elegoo Saturn has been repaired and is now fully functional! The rebooting issue we were having was due to a malfunctioning power switch. The machine has been retrofitted with a new rocker switch and the reboot problem has not been observed since. Thank you to Stan for helping identify the issue, and to Daniel for doing some test prints!

Reminder that **if you have completed resin printer training, you are able to use the Elegoo Mars 1 and the Elegoo Saturn 3 printers, and their associated wash & cure stations.** Remember to use gloves and safety glasses while operating any of the resin printers or cleaning stations.

The wiki page for the Saturn has been updated, and is located here:

Thanks everyone, and happy printing!
