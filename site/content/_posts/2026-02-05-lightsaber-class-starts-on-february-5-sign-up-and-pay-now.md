MAKE Roanoke is teaming up with the Lightsaber Club at Virginia Tech Lightsaber Class to offer a make your own lightsaber class. These light sabers feature aluminum hilts, light-up blades, and electronics so they play sound effects as you swing them around and hit things with them. You can also opt for a less-expensive, and simpler option as well.

This class will consist of a demonstration on February 5 from 6:00PM-9:00PM, where attendees will watch one lightsaber hilt being made on the lathe. Each lightsaber hilt will take ~12 hours to complete, so attendees will make their hilts after the class in multiple guided sessions, scheduled individually. Those with lathe experience can operate more independently. Total project time (hilt, electronics, blade, final steps) is approximately 20 hours, but you can spend as much time as you want!

Making a lightsaber requires a considerable material cost which attendees will pay upfront. Attendees will purchase materials from us at-cost and we will pay shipping. We get special discounts, so it would be more expensive if you bought the parts yourself. 

**Due to the intense time commitment, you must be a MAKE Roanoke member to participate.** This class is for ages 18+

For any questions, please email max@makeroanoke.org . Due date for signups and payment is **January 22**!

There will be a cap of 5 signups. If you can complete the form, we haven't hit the cap yet!
