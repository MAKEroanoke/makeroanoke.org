Join us online on Google Meet for our monthly Virtual Community Meetings on the Second Monday of each month at 6 pm! No sign-in is required to participate! [https://meet.google.com/ckf-jaic-knt](https://meet.google.com/ckf-jaic-knt?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0I87MPxEC08SRY4Sx0Wff900Qm-Yim7_sSMIk-WqTq5589seAJseGMOZc_aem_1Bo1hNJsLG4ISssxeKfDSg)

The evening starts with a slideshow sharing the latest updates about Roanoke's own non-profit community makerspace, including upcoming events, new tools, and member announcements. After the updates, we open the floor for "Maker Show and Tell" where anyone can showcase their creative projects--whether it's a 3D Print, a woodworking piece, electronics project, embroidery, or any other creative endeavor.

It's a great way to connect with your fellow Roanoke makers, get inspired, collaborate, and share your passion for making!

These meetings are free and open to the public, you do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to attend! All are welcome, and feel free to lurk!
