In this introductory 3D modeling class, students will learn essential concepts and techniques to create their own digital models. Through hands-on practice, they’ll model a LEGO Technic brick and discover fundamental tools like sketching, extrusion, and reading technical drawings to create precise designs. By the end of the session, students will be equipped with foundational skills to start bringing their design ideas to life in 3D.

This class will be taught Nick Dunne, Ettelie Lovern and Max Bareiss. It will be taught at MAKE Roanoke at 128 Albemarle Ave SE Unit B.
