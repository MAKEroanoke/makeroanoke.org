MAKE Roanoke is thrilled to be participating in the Daisy Art Parade again this year! For those who don't know, the Daisy Art Parade is a parade in Roanoke of giant puppets that people in our community make! All puppets must be man-powered (IE no cars towing them!) and using recycled material is highly encouraged. This year the parade is on May 9 and is held in conjunction with a Carnival! [You can learn more about the parade here.](https://daisyartparade.com/)
