This class will cover navigating in Blender and the basics of mesh modeling. Participants will make a low poly wolf model suitable for 3D printing. This class is intended for beginners, no prior Blender experience is necessary.

This class will be taught by Ettelie Lovern and Jonathan Styles. The class will be 3 hours, with the first 1/2 hour for setup and the last 1/2 hour to stay behind to finish.

**Students MUST bring a laptop with Blender 5.0 installed.** We will be using Blender 5.0 ([Download Blender 5.0](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/5-0/)) a free, open-source software. Since we will only be generating models with the intention to 3D Print them and will not be doing live animations, the [system requirements](https://www.blender.org/download/requirements/) can be relaxed, and any fairly recent laptop should do a good job of running Blender. Also, **please bring a mouse with 3 buttons** (left, right, clickable scroll wheel, or 3 regular buttons) if you have it, it will make moving around within Blender much easier.

Cost to attend is $25, and cost for MAKE Roanoke Members is $15. MAKE Roanoke Members can also bring one guest at the discounted member rate.

This class is open to the public, you do not need to be a MAKE Roanoke Member to attend. This class is recommended for those age 16+ and is suitable for beginners.
