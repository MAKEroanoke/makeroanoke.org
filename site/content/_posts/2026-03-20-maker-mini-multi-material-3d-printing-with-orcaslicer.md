Join us at MAKE Roanoke with another FREE Maker Mini as we show you techniques to achieve a multi-material or multi-color 3D Print!

This Maker Mini introduces the fundamentals of using OrcaSlicer for multi-material and multicolor 3D printing. Students will learn how to assign different materials or colors to specific parts of a model, optimize print time, and set up dissimilar material supports for clean overhangs. We’ll cover preparing multi-body models, using painting tools, and managing filament changes.

**Students are encouraged to bring a laptop with Orcaslicer to follow along if desired.**

This Maker Mini is FREE and open to the public, you do NOT need to be a MAKE Roanoke member to attend. It is recommended for ages 14 and up.
