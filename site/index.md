### MAKE Roanoke is launching a Kickstarter campaign to open a Makerspace in Roanoke, VA
MAKE Roanoke has already raised nearly $10,000 from individual contributions, membership dues, class fees and more. We’re currently negotiating a lease for a location in the heart of Roanoke. We've also received some generous donations of equipment, but we need YOUR HELP to cross the finish line!


## Campaign Overview

We are launching this Kickstarter campaign on **October 24th** to fund equipment purchases for our space. We already have some amazing tools donated, including 3D printers, an industrial sewing machine, a mill, soldering & electronics equipment, and an embroidery machine. Our initial funding goal will round out our tool offerings so makers of all crafts can build their next project at MAKE Roanoke. This includes: 
* **Woodshop:** basic woodworking equipment including a circular saw, router, hand tools, miter saw, power drill, and a shop vacuum
* **Metal shop:** basic machining equipment such as lathe, mill, dial indicators, test indicators & indicator stands
* **Laser Cutter and Papercrafts:**  A basic tabletop laser cutter, a Cricut and accessories
* **3D Printing:** 3 FDM (filament) printers and 1 resin printer
* **Electronics Equipment:**  Oscilloscope, power supply, soldering irons and accessories
* **Fabric Arts:** 2 basic sewing machines, 1 embroidery machine, 1 industrial/heavy duty sewing machine, and basic sewing, knitting/crocheting and crafting materials

Any money we raise beyond our initial goal will help us purchase more equipment to expand the capability of these shop areas.  You can view our complete Wishlist [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rpxGDL9YX55xHcfo7G_rz2gTV6zZtfnp93o3o_Vh__E/edit?usp=sharing)!

We have some awesome Backer Rewards available to thank you for supporting this campaign, including swag to show your support and unique items crafted by makers from our community. There’s even a lifetime membership up for grabs!

## The Need for a Makerspace in Roanoke, VA

Roanoke has a thriving creative community, but does not have an adequate location for these individuals to meet and create together. Our makerspace will provide access to tools, training, and community to help artists, engineers, and hobbyists bring their ideas to life. Specifically, our makerspace focuses on:
### Promoting Equity through Access
Our makerspace will provide access to space and equipment via a monthly membership structure, with discounts for students and low income individuals. This is especially important for those who may not have the space or funds to purchase these tools on their own. Our goal is to democratize access to creative outlets by sharing space, equipment and knowledge.

### Opportunities for Skill Development
MAKE Roanoke gives the opportunity for individuals to enhance their skills and knowledge in various fields, from woodworking to coding and everything in between. It's a haven for creativity where people can tinker, experiment, and learn.

### Promoting Entrepreneurship

Makerspaces are not just for hobbyists – they also provide an important space for budding entrepreneurs. Many Etsy shops and the like build their wares using tools like the ones we will have at MAKE Roanoke, and by providing access to said tools we are lowering the cost for someone to start their own business.

Our community demonstrates a clear demand for these benefits – our Discord has over 150 members, and we already have over 30 makers paying membership dues prior to the space opening! Our monthly classes are well-attended and have done a great job of teaching new skills to our community members and advancing our mission!
